#
# Report:
#       Produce a tab-delimited report with the following output fields:
#
#       MGD ID
#       Gene Symbol
#       Gene Name
#       Chromosome
#       cM Position
#       Ensembl Gene ID
#
# Usage:
#       MRK_ENSEMBL.py
#
# History:
#
# lec   10/22/2014
#       - TR11750/postres complient
#
# lec   02/09/2011
#	- this is similar to the report on public, but specific for Sophia
#	  and the ${PG_DBUTILS}/bin/generateGIAssoc.csh product
#
# lec	08/26/2003
#	- added to reports_db product
#	- changed order of cM position and chromosome to be consistent
#	  with other Sequence reports.
#	- added outputdir, import os
#
# dbm   12/13/2002
#       - created
#
# NOTE: This report is a variation of the daily report with the same name.
#       It does not get copied to the FTP site and is only used by the
#       mgddbutilities product to generate the input file for the NIA
#       association load.
