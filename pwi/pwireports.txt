# purpose:
#       this file contains the list of python reports used by the pwi/custom report index page:
#               http://prodwww.informatics.jax.org/pwi/report/index
#
#       any creation, update or deletion of a report requires a WTS2 ticket request
#       most new requests are issued by curators
#       to see a create/update/delete of this file, simply refresh the associated pwi/custom report index page
#
# field 1: report name  : the base name for the report (no extension). 
#     A report consists of a python script and (optionally) an html file.
#     If report name is "foo", then the script is "foo.py" and 
#     the html form (if needed) is in "foo.html". 
#     The report script defines a function named "go" that takes a
#     single argument, which is the parsed query form.
#     (If a report does not have a query form, None is passed.)
#               def go (form) :
#                  # report logic starts here
#     The report script writes tab-delimited lines to stdout.
#     The first line contains column names
# field 2: display name : as shown to the user
# field 3: description : what the report does
# field 4: created by : an SE
# field 5: requested by : a curator
# field 6: creation date : when the report was implemented
# field 7: argumentLabel : either blank, a human readable parameter label, or a "*"
#       if blank:
#           the report takes no user-supplied parameters
#       if a label (anything that's not blank and not a "*"): 
#           the report takes a single user-supplied text parameter. The user is shown a form
#           with a type-in box labelled with the argumentLabel value. 
#           This value is passed as field "arg" in the form object.
#       if "*": 
#           a custom form is defined in the report's .html file.
