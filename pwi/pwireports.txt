#
# purpose:
#       this file contains the list of python reports used by the pwi/custom report index page:
#               http://prodwww.informatics.jax.org/pwi/report/index
#
#       any creation, update or deletion of a report requires a WTS2 ticket request
#       most new requests are issued by curators
#       to see a create/update/delete of this file, simply refresh the associated pwi/custom report index page
#
# pipe-delimited file
# field 1: script name  : the specific *py file that will be run from the PWI/Custom Report Index/Report Detail/Run or Download button
# field 2: display name
# field 3: description
# field 4: created by
# field 5: requested by
# field 6: creation date
# field 7: argumentLabel : either blank, a human readable parameter label, or a "*"
#       if blank:
#           the report takes no user-supplied parameters
#       if a label (anything that's not blank and not a "*"): 
#           the report takes a single user-supplied text parameter. The user is shown a form
#           with a type-in box labelled with the argumentLabel value. This value is supplied as sys.argv[1] to the
#           python script in field 1
#       if "*": 
#           custom form parameters are defined in a .html file. If the script (field 1) is "foo", the file is 
#           "foo.html" in the same directory. foo.py is responsible for getting the form parameter values (import cgi, then
#           form = cgi.FormStorage())
