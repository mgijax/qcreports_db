GXD_HTExperimentByNote.py|GXD HT Experiment Note Search|This report would display searches of the Experiment Note field.

GXD_HTResultByNote.py|GXD Result Note Search|Searches InSitu Result Notes by note text (via contains search). \r\nSearch is restricted to Immunohistochemistry, In situ reporter (knock-in) and RNA in situ assays. \r\n \r\nCase insensitive.  "%" is wildcard for multiple characters. "?" is wildcard for a single character.  Spaces, alphanumerics, and most "punctuation" characters (except wildcards) are recognized literally as searchable characters.  \r\n \r\nWords are AND'ed together. Word order is enforced. Uses a Contains search on each word, so "respond to" also will return "correspond to". \r\n \r\nSome results are a little unpredictable because browsers will suppress extra spaces in the display that do exist in the data, for example, search for "section.  In" (no quotes, two spaces after the period) and compare to display.|lec|Connie Smith|2015-02-20
